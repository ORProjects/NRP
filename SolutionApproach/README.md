`SOLUTION APPROACH`
====================
## The Hybrid Algorithm

<p align="justify">Personnel scheduling is not a new area of study for the Operations Research community. It has been studied since 1950s. But Today's problem is fairly different than its original version. Planners must consider many elements before developing a schedule. Employees have part-time and full-time opportunities. Planners must also account for employees' preferences in this planning process.</p>
